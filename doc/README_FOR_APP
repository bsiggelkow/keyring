== Keyring: A Keyword Search Engine

== Description
Keyring is a simple web application that uses the Yahoo BOSS (Build your Own Search Service)
API to search the web based on user-specified keywords and phrases. This application was built
as a sample application for interfacing to BOSS via the Bossman Ruby-gem. 

This branch uses jRails and JQuery.
